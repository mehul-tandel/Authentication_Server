# Authentication_Server
- Use jwt to authorize a user to get resources through api endpoints
- Use bcryptjs to authenticate a user or create new password hashes for new users
- Use mysql for the database to store user credentials
## I made this project to try and test out the concepts I learnt like a sandbox, not meant to be used in production.
